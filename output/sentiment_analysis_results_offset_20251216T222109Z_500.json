Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. \n\nI always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very \ngood. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.\n\nSeasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. \n\nThe service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. \n\nI can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as \"the best food item\" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. \n\nI look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!",

She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had.

The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding.

Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.",

The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good.

Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous.

But something that I crave everyday! \n\nThis particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.\n\nI always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru.

Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go.

Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say \"we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried.\" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! \nTime that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.\nI should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. \nDon't waste your time or money!!!\nStay away! Any other place is better than here!",

I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we \"screened\" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional.",

Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).\n\nLike Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. \n\nMy dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.\n\nI did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. \n\nI didn't get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn't think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.",

Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \"closed-system\" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.
