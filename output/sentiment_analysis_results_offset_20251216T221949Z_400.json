      "text": "A great spot to take out-of-town guests. I take all my Chicago friends here and they fall in love. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.\n\nThe burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. \n\nAnother unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. \n\nThe only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done. I still ate it, but it wasn't really what I expected.",

People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.",

I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb, Chicken, Adana, and gyro kebab meats, so tender and expertly spiced and grilled, along with a shepherds salad, grilled half tomatoes, rice, and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees, sides, salad bar, and drinks, and you have to try the rice pudding.

Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don't know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \n\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter.

They never have a problem seating our group of about 12-15 and are pleasant and quick service. \n\nThe energetic owner likes to roam around making sure everything is going well. In my opinion, the food is also better than the chains. The secret ingredient is love.",

Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle.

The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card.

It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  \n\nThey bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.

My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.  \n\nDefinitely go to Mr. B's!",

Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \n\nI am a fan!

We we able to get street parking about 2 blocks down the street, so that is always a plus.  \n\nService was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  \n\nFor our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  \n\nDessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.",
